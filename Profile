    Whitelist based on Shell:
        with shell, user can turn on/turn off/add/check/delete/update ips to whitelist which has right to access admin website.
        A shell file contains all functions.
        A command in UI can invoke this file.
        Upgrade will backup and restore datas in iptables.
        .spec -> build .RPM packages(are used for installing Linux programs)
        
        /etc/passwd:
        username:password:user ID:group ID:user ID info:home directory:command/shell
        if password is x character that indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow
        
        /etc/shadow:
        username:password:last password change(since 1970-1-1):minimum:maximum:warn:inactive:expire
        
        whitelist.sh
        iptables:
        
        grep:
        
        =~/regular expression:
        
        sed:
        
        awk:
        
        PGPASSWORD=Polycom@12#$ psql -U postgres postgres -c 'select * from ca_wsp.whitelistswitch' > status
        PGPASSWORD=Polycom@12#$ psql -U postgres postgres -qc "update ca_wsp.whitelistswitch set enableflag='0'"
		PGPASSWORD=Polycom@12#$	psql -U postgres postgres -qc "delete from ca_wsp.whitelistconfig where subnet like '%$IP%'"

        $@: stores all the arguments in a list of string
        $*: stores all the arguments as a single string
        $#: stores the number of arguments
